## JavaScript and Podcasts are hot

Although podcasts are not a new thing, they have exploded in popularity over the last
several years. Likewise, JavaScript is also not new, but has continued to grow
exponentially and is used in all sorts of ways from building user interfaces to
writing serverless functions. It is no surprise that there are also a growing
number of podcasts centering around web development and JavaScript, but which
ones should you listen to? We'll break down the top five JavaScript podcasts to
listen to, to stay up to date on the latest JavaScript trends.

## Syntax

If you have been around the web development scene for awhile, you have probably heard
of CSS-Tricks and/or CodePen, and if you have, you are likely also familiar with their
founder, Chris Coyier.

## JS Party

## Whiskey Web and Whatnot

We may be a bit biased here, but we think our podcast Whiskey Web and Whatnot has a great
format as both an informative JavaScript podcast and an entertaining fireside chat with
some of your favorite devs, like the aforementioned Wes Bos and Chris Coyier, as well as
other prominent developers like Charlie Gerard, Kelly Vaughn, and Kent C. Dodds.
