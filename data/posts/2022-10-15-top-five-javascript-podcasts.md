## Which JavaScript podcasts are the hottest?

Although podcasts are not a new thing, they have exploded in popularity over the
last several years. Likewise, JavaScript is also not new, but has continued to
grow exponentially and is used in all sorts of ways from building user
interfaces to writing serverless functions.

It is no surprise that there are also a growing number of podcasts centering
around web development and JavaScript, but which ones should you listen to?
We'll break down the top five JavaScript podcasts to listen to, to stay up to
date on the latest JavaScript trends.

## 1. [Syntax](https://syntax.fm/)

One of _the_ most popular, and tastiest web development podcasts out there is
[Syntax](https://syntax.fm/) by [Scott Tolinski](https://twitter.com/stolinski)
and [Wes Bos](https://twitter.com/wesbos). They keep things lighthearted and fun
with games like Stump'd where they do random JavaScript interview questions and
try to stump one another.

They release three episodes a week of various formats, a short "Hasty Treat", a
longer "Tasty Treat", and their relatively new Supper Club where they interview
guests from the developer community.

## 2. [Shop Talk Show](https://shoptalkshow.com/)

If you have been around the web development scene for a while, you have probably
heard of [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) and/or
[CodePen](https://codepen.io/), and if you have, you are likely also familiar
with their founder, [Chris Coyier](https://twitter.com/chriscoyier). He and
[Dave Rupert](https://twitter.com/davatron5000) release episodes of
[Shop Talk](https://shoptalkshow.com/) weekly for the Shopamaniacs and cover a
wide range of topics from JavaScript and CSS to parenting and hot topics of the
day.

## 3. [JS Party](https://changelog.com/jsparty)

[JS Party](https://changelog.com/jsparty) has had many hosts over the years and
countless guests all doing deep dives into various web development topics. From
new browser features coming out, to fancy ways to do page layouts with one line
of CSS, to the latest JavaScript frameworks, they get deep into the technical
details of their topics to help keep you up to date.

## 4. [Whiskey Web and Whatnot](https://www.whiskeywebandwhatnot.fm/)

We may be a bit biased here, but we think our podcast
[Whiskey Web and Whatnot](https://www.whiskeywebandwhatnot.fm/) has a great
format as both an informative JavaScript podcast and an entertaining fireside
chat with some of your favorite devs, like the aforementioned Wes Bos and Chris
Coyier, as well as other prominent developers like Charlie Gerard, Kelly Vaughn,
and Kent C. Dodds.

If you're looking for something a little less technical, find an episode that
sounds interesting, grab a glass, and have a drink with us.

## 5. [Front End Happy Hour](https://www.frontendhappyhour.com/)

[![Front End Happy Hour podcast logo](/img/blog/top-five-javascript-podcasts/front-end-hh.jpg)](https://www.frontendhappyhour.com/)

[Front End Happy Hour](https://www.frontendhappyhour.com/) is another somewhat
less formal option featuring a panel of Software Engineers from Netflix, Twitch,
and Atlassian talking over drinks about Frontend, JavaScript, and career
development.

They have lots of guests from the Netflix engineering team, so it gives you a
peek into how one of the hottest tech companies is approaching their web apps.
They also talk about things such as job hunting, interview prep, and dealing
with burnout.

## Wrap-up

We think these are the top 5 JavaScript podcasts currently, but new podcasts are
released all the time and this is not an exhaustive list. If we missed one of
your favorites, let us know on Twitter!
