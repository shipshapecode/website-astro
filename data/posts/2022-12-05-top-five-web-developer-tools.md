## When was the last time you updated your web development tools?

I don't know about you, but when I find tools I like to use for web development,
I tend to stick with them for many, many years. This isn't necessarily a bad
thing, but in the past year or two a lot of new and interesting tools have
dropped, and I am loving using them.

I think, at this point, most of us know about VSCode, and while I do use it
daily, I am not going to be highlighting it in this post. So, without further
ado, let's jump into a list of my top five developer tools for working on and
consuming the web in 2023 and beyond.

## 1. [Arc](https://thebrowser.company/)

It has been a long time since I got excited about a new browser. It seems like
most "new" browsers are just a Chrome clone that has been reskinned and maybe
has a few extra features. Chrome is a great browser, don't get me wrong, and
browsers like Brave have made Chromium even cooler, but The Browser Company has
dramatically changed the game with their new browser: Arc.

Arc moves your tabs to the left side and introduces the concept of Spaces, which
allows you to organize your tabs by category. For example, I have Spaces for
personal, work, and podcasting. There is also an ever-present favorites bar for
sites you visit extremely frequently.

Perhaps the best feature, of their reimagination of tabs, is you can set the
tabs to auto close. For tab hoarders like me, this is a game changer, and keeps
my huge tabs collection in check.

Arc also has great keyboard support, with a command palette-like interface when
you press `CMD + T`. This maps to your existing muscle memory of opening a new
tab, but allows you to perform multiple different actions, instead of just
opening a tab.

There are many other features and quality-of-life improvements baked into Arc,
so give it a try for yourself and see what you think!

## 2. [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/)

## 3. [Zed](https://zed.dev/)

## 5. [GitHub Desktop](https://www.frontendhappyhour.com/)

This one flies under the radar and is very underrated, in my opinion. There are a lot of very powerful tools for git built around power users and handling complex workflows, but if you use GitHub and you want something simple and intuitive to push and pull code, GitHub Desktop is a great tool.

## Wrap-up

I think these are the top 5 web developer tools people should be checking out in 2023 and beyond. If there is a developer tool you think should have been on this list, let us know on Twitter!
