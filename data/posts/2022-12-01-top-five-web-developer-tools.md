## When was the last time you updated your web development tools?

I don't know about you, but when I find tools I like to use for web development,
I tend to stick with them for many, many years. This isn't necessarily a bad
thing, but in the past year or two a lot of new and interesting tools have
dropped, and I am loving using them.

I wanted to highlight my top five developer tools for working on and consuming
the web in 2023 and beyond.

## 1. [Arc](https://thebrowser.company/)

It has been a long time since I got excited about a new browser. It seems like
most "new" browsers are just a Chrome clone that has been reskinned and maybe
has a few extra features. Chrome is a great browser, don't get me wrong, and
browsers like Brave have made Chromium even cooler, but The Browser Company has
really dramatically changed the game with their new browser: Arc.

## 2. [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/)

## 4. [Whiskey Web and Whatnot](https://www.whiskeywebandwhatnot.fm/)

We may be a bit biased here, but we think our podcast
[Whiskey Web and Whatnot](https://www.whiskeywebandwhatnot.fm/) has a great
format as both an informative JavaScript podcast and an entertaining fireside
chat with some of your favorite devs, like the aforementioned Wes Bos and Chris
Coyier, as well as other prominent developers like Charlie Gerard, Kelly Vaughn,
and Kent C. Dodds.

If you're looking for something a little less technical, find an episode that
sounds interesting, grab a glass, and have a drink with us.

## 5. [Front End Happy Hour](https://www.frontendhappyhour.com/)

[![Front End Happy Hour podcast logo](/img/blog/top-five-javascript-podcasts/front-end-hh.jpg)](https://www.frontendhappyhour.com/)

[Front End Happy Hour](https://www.frontendhappyhour.com/) is another somewhat
less formal option featuring a panel of Software Engineers from Netflix, Twitch,
and Atlassian talking over drinks about Frontend, JavaScript, and career
development.

They have lots of guests from the Netflix engineering team, so it gives you a
peek into how one of the hottest tech companies is approaching their web apps.
They also talk about things such as job hunting, interview prep, and dealing
with burnout.

## Wrap-up

We think these are the top 5 JavaScript podcasts currently, but new podcasts are
released all the time and this is not an exhaustive list. If we missed one of
your favorites, let us know on Twitter!
