          step-by-step application tours and feature introductions to help new users
          get up to speed quickly with your web app.

        <p class="max-w-5xl mb-16">
          We've leveraged the flexibility of these tours to lead users through a
          number of events. Upon the first time logging into an application,
          tours can be used to validate and ensure a smooth setup process.

                <p>
                  Introducing new users to the features of your product can help
                  them get up and running much more quickly than if they were
                  exploring the app on their own. If a new user gets confused
                  with how to use your app, they may become frustrated and
                  abandon your product all together. An application tour
                  smoothly guides them through everything, for a great first
                  impression.

                <p>
                  After spending countless hours refreshing your app flow, you
                  want to ensure your existing users are not confused when they
                  encounter the latest changes for the first time. Your existing
                  visitors can be shown the exciting new features and how to
                  maximize their ability to complete important tasks to ensure
                  long term effectiveness for the investments you've made to
                  improve your software.

                <p>
                  If your product onboarding is a large, multi-step process; it
                  is helpful to break it up into multiple tours. This allows you
                  to keep each tour small and focused, so it is not overwhelming
                  to the user. They can then complete each section at their own
                  pace. You can also track their progress to continue
                  encouraging them to complete all the onboarding steps. We've
                  use Shepherd tours to do basic signup, lead a customer in
                  their second login, create additional accounts, and more
                  detailed processes such as creating branding profiles in a
                  white label web application.
