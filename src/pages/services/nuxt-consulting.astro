          At Ship Shape, we love Nuxt.js because it’s still an opinionated
          framework (though not quite as opinionated as Ember.js), and it has
          features that strip out unused code to make your app fast and
          lightweight. You’ll enjoy its approachable syntax, easy-to-read read
          templates, and more.

          Whether you're building a brand new web app or elevating an existing

          process.
