      <p class="mb-12">
        Users of Outreach’s legacy software were asking for new features and
        improved notifications of urgent or past due tasks. In addition,
        Outreach’s ability to maintain the application at scale was difficult
        due to a highly coupled Ruby and React architecture. Outreach needed to
        accelerate the replatforming of their primary SaaS product to use more
        maintainable, faster, and reliable modern technologies.

      <p>
        Ship Shape's team of experts immediately improved velocity and started
        delivering features in the updated application. The new application used
        a microservices API architecture, a custom GraphQL layer, and
        micro-frontend based apps tied together with an entry single page
        application. We worked to establish strong communication channels with
        the team with worldwide distribution.

          <p>
            Our team owned the desktop notification feature to implement an
            application wide strategy for creating, managing, and adding custom
            actions to notifications. This also resulted in some newly acquired
            expertise for our team that we shared in <a

          <p>
            We added significant functionality to the way Outreach presented
            tabular data, delivering a highly customizable solution that was
            well received by internal and external customers. The solution
            involved creating a configurable tabular data display component that
            could have custom views for each column based on the data model or
            be customized for a specific user's needs. This introduced the
            concept of "smart views" to the overall application, and allowed
            users to have data presented to them in the fastest, most useful,
            and efficient ways.
