            <a href="https://www.askenigma.com/">Enigma</a> is a platform designed
            to help cybersecurity teams make faster hiring decisions and find stronger,
            more diverse talent. Through this web application, employers can create
            and assign technical assessments to candidates to ascertain their level
            of competency with key cybersecurity concepts and industry best practices.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once a candidate has completed an assessment through the Enigma
            platform, employers can review their responses and overall
            performance and then use these findings to better evaluate the
            candidate’s application.

      <p class="mb-12">
        The Enigma assessment application was in a very raw proof of concept
        state when Ship Shape was brought in to act as the development team that
        would create a production-ready product. Enigma already had customers
        signed up and ready to start utilizing the application for their
        recruiting needs, but still had a substantial roadmap of features in
        need of implementation. Ship Shape’s challenge was to implement
        essential features, including the full assessment workflow and
        corresponding administrative tasks, in order to launch Enigma. We
        continued to help build out the application based on customers’ feedback
        about their additional needs.

      <h3 class="text-2xl mb-6">Next.js</h3>

      <p>
        The development team made use of
        <a href="/https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> to prioritize quick loading times
        on the client side of this application. The server-side rendering capabilities
        of Next.js allow the Enigma application to retrieve web pages and any corresponding
        data in one go, eliminating the need for multiple network requests and preventing
        subsequent delays in data population.

          <p>
            The Ship Shape team also had the opportunity to integrate one of our
            own open source projects,
            <a href="https://shepherdjs.dev/docs/">Shepherd</a>, into the Enigma
            platform. The Shepherd library provides a way to guide users through
            a tour of a web application, highlighting the key features users
            should familiarize themselves with, in order to use the app at its
            full potential.

          An employer's ability to create, view, assign, archive, and delete
          assessments and candidate assessment attempts
        </li>
        <li class="list-disc">
          An optional package that would allow employers to assign a
          supplemental personality evaluation that would accompany a candidate's
