          <p>
            <a href="https://www.askenigma.com/">Enigma</a> is a platform designed
            to help cybersecurity teams make faster hiring decisions and find stronger,
            more diverse talent. Through this web application, employers can create
            and assign technical assessments to candidates to ascertain their level
            of competency with key cybersecurity concepts and industry best practices.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once a candidate has completed an assessment through the Enigma
            platform, employers can review their responses and overall
            performance and then use these findings to better evaluate the
            candidate’s application.

        <p>
          The Enigma assessment application was in a very raw proof of concept
          state when Ship Shape was brought in to act as the development team
          that would create a production-ready product. Enigma already had
          customers signed up and ready to start utilizing the application for
          their recruiting needs, but still had a substantial roadmap of
          features in need of implementation. Ship Shape’s challenge was to
          implement essential features, including the full assessment workflow
          and corresponding administrative tasks, in order to launch Enigma. We
          continued to help build out the application based on customers’
          feedback about their additional needs.

        <h2 class="text-4xl mb-6">Solution</h2>

        <h3 class="text-2xl mb-6">Next.js</h3>

        <p>
          The development team made use of
          <a href="/https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> to prioritize quick loading
          times on the client side of this application. The server-side rendering
          capabilities of Next.js allow the Enigma application to retrieve web pages
          and any corresponding data in one go, eliminating the need for multiple
          network requests and preventing subsequent delays in data population.

            <p>
              The Ship Shape team also had the opportunity to integrate one of
              our own open source projects,
              <a href="https://shepherdjs.dev/docs/">Shepherd</a>, into the
              Enigma platform. The Shepherd library provides a way to guide
              users through a tour of a web application, highlighting the key
              features users should familiarize themselves with, in order to use
              the app at its full potential.
