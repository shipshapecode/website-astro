      As a non-profit, it’s critical for the Center for Open Science (COS) to
      understand and communicate how funding is used. We developed custom
      Ember.js dashboards for COS that provide visibility into how people are
      using its system.
    </p>

    <h4>Results:</h4>

    <p class="italic">
      Helped the organization report back to its funders, reinforce the value of
      their investment, and hopefully attract additional funds in the future.

      Our partnership with the enterprise app development team from Scout
      focused on upgrading their app for dog walkers and enhancing its
      scheduling features. Our first order of business was updating the app to
      the latest versions of Ember and Ember CLI, adding Ember Suave, and
      adhering to the new set of ESLint rules. Then, we worked extensively on
      the appointment scheduling experience using full-screen overlays, Ember
      Flatpickr, Ember Paper, and Ember Power Select to make creating and
      editing appointments easier.
    </p>

    <h4>Results:</h4>

    <p class="italic">
      Saved users time and improved the experience, driving more repeat business
      and revenue for Scout.

    <p>
      Our team collaborated with the engineers behind Anvyl’s supplier
      relationship management software to create a new messaging feature that
      allows brands and suppliers to communicate directly within the Anvyl app,
      rather than via email. By integrating many common messaging features, such
      as threaded replies, in-line editing, avatars, and more, we simplified the
      experience for both the customer and the supplier.
    </p>

    <h4>Results:</h4>

    <p class="italic">
      Customers now receive better, faster service, and suppliers can respond
      quicker while reducing errors.

      After building a proof of concept using Ember.js, this fitness business
      management app had gradually strayed from best practices. Their software
      developers brought in our team to get them back on track. We worked side
      by side to not only apply consistent, up-to-date Ember coding practices
      (e.g., adding several ESLint rules from eslint-plugin-ember, updating
      various dependencies, etc.), but also realign the team and get everyone on
      the same page.
    </p>

    <h4>Results:</h4>

    <p class="italic">
      Saved Mariana Tek time and money, increased efficiency, and made
      onboarding new developers much easier.

    <p>
      We partnered with the Rabble team to bring their open source MUSICat
      platform up to date. Our work included removing bower in favor of npm,
      migrating from ic-ajax to ember-ajax, enforcing consistent code quality
      with ESLint, and other improvements. Our software developers also served
      as Ember subject matter experts who helped mentor the Rabble team and grow
      their Ember knowledge.
    </p>

    <h4>Results:</h4>

    <p class="italic">
      MUSICat’s platform is faster, more performant, and easier to maintain, and
      the Rabble team is ready to carry on the work.
